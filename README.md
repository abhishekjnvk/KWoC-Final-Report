### # About KWoC
KWoC (Kharagpur Winter Of Code) is an annual open-source program conducted by Kharagpur Open Source Society, IIT Kharagpur. It is a five-week-long program that runs during the month of December. It is aimed at promoting open source participation and helping students prepare for events like GSoC. 

### # About Me
I’m a pre-final undergraduate student in the Department of Production & Industrial Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur. I’ve been coding for a few years and I love to try out new projects in my spare time. I strongly believe that coders are the magicians of the era!

###  # My KWoC Experience 
I heard about KWoC from my senior in Programming club of nit Jamshedpur. KWoC has granted work with multiple people on a project. KWoC showed me the merits of the Git Version Control system and I also had the privilege of meeting some of the highly motivated and enthusiastic people through my project. It was bliss to see how everyone wanted to grasp the learning opportunities at the earliest and cleared up issues as soon as they popped.  I’m blessed to have such a group to learn from for my winter break and I’m thankful to KOSS for the same


### # CHOOSING A PROJECT 
I had enrolled in KWoC and now it was time to choose the projects in which we want to work.It was very confusing, trying to find out a project which suited me better, as there were many projects.  I chose three projects and started working on it 

###### Projects I have worked on 
* [Nature Beauty](https://github.com/Surajbokde/Nature_Beauty)
* [URL shortener](https://github.com/the-browser-toolbox/url-shortener)
* [Rotten Script](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts)


### # Summary Of Contributions
I started off my KwoC contribution by changing the footer of the project called [“nature-beauty”](https://github.com/Surajbokde/Nature_Beauty) and then I connected the site to the database and started logging the input from the website. After that, I changed all HTML codes to PHP and fix all changes according to it, and connects all HTML forms to the database.  Meanwhile, in another project named ["browser toolbox’s URL shortener"](https://github.com/the-browser-toolbox/url-shortener), I added a new option to shorten the URL by right-clicking anywhere on a page which makes the whole process a little bit faster. In another project named ["rotten-script"](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Rotten-Scripts), I added a script to download a publicly available google drive file from the terminal. This script will be helpful to create automation in the downloading file. 


### # Future Of The Project
Nature-beauty is planned to be launch very soon. Another project Browser toolbox’s URL Shortener is planned to be launch very soon on the google chrome extension store, Firefox addon  & opera extension store. The Rotten script is helpful in making things automated.
